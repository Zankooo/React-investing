# 📊 Visual Comparator: Passive ETFs vs Active Mutual Funds

[🇸🇮 Preberi v slovenščini](./slo_readme/README.md)

## 🎯 Purpose
This program provides a graphical comparison between passive ETFs on one side and actively managed mutual funds on the other. The goal is to show how seemingly small annual management fees (2–3%) in actively managed funds can significantly reduce long-term returns.

## 📝 Note
While passive ETFs also have fees (typically between 0.07% and 0.2%), these costs were ignored in the program and assumed to be 0%. This is because ETF fees are much lower compared to the management fees of actively managed mutual funds.
